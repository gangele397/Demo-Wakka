{"Nokia Lumia 520 8GB Windows AT&T GoPhone for $29 + free shipping":"Microsoft Store offers the Nokia Lumia 520 4G 8GB Windows 8 Prepaid Smartphone for AT&T GoPhone for $29 with free shipping . That's tied with our mention from two weeks ago and the lowest total price we could find by $11.

(A free Windows Phone 8.1 update is available.)","AdDuplex: Microsoft likely to show off 4 unannounced devices at MWC 2015":"AdDuplex has released their monthly stats based on their cross-promotional Windows Phone ad network. This month there has not been any massive changes, but there is on-going signs of good performance by Microsoft\u2019s low-end handsets, in particular the Lumia 530, 535 and 630\/635. It is however unlikely that any of these handsets have broken the 10 million unit sale numbers yet like the 520 did. Some handsets do better in some countries than others however, with the Lumia 535 appearing a massive hit in India, growing from less than 5% of the market in December 2014 to 9.1% in January 2015 and now 15% in February 2015. In UK on the other hand the Lumia 630\/635 is doing well and together now make up 24.4% of the market, finally outnumbering the Lumia 520 with 20.1% of the market. In US the Lumia 635 is also doing well, gaining 4.9% share since last month. AdDuplex notes that there are now more low-end 2014 Windows Phone 8 handsets (Lumia 630\/635, 530) than low-end 2013 Lumias (520\/21). Microsoft Mobile\/Nokia continue to dominate the OEM picture, now with 96% of the installed base, but Other (ie the new Windows Reference Device OEMs) have grown from 0.26 to 0.35% of the market, and seems set to soon over take Huawei and even Samsung. It seems however (assuming around 70 million windows phones in the market) they have still sold less than 1\/4 million handsets all combined. AdDuplex notes that Windows Phone 8.1 handsets are now more than 2\/3 of the market, but that the rate of growth appears to suggest new sales rather than upgrades, suggesting some work still needs to be done to reach out to the 21.3% of the users still using the older version of the OS. Interestingly 0.2% of Windows Phone users are already trying out Windows 10, which is a massive number. Regarding new devices, AdDuplex notes: Unreleased phones February 19th, AdDuplex Mobile World Congress is just around the corner and there\u2019s a lot of speculation of what phones Microsoft may announce or launch there. Here\u2019s what we see in our stats: Microsoft\/Nokia RM-1031 \u2013 480\u00d7800, 4\u2033. Seen all over the place so must be close to launch. Interestingly searching for this model number online returns matches for Nokia XL (short-lived Android phone) Microsoft\/Nokia RM-1062, 63 (AT&T), 64, 65, 66, 67 \u2013 720\u00d71280, 5.7\u2033. We\u2019ve covered these before, but now we see quite a lot of them (including one version on AT&T in US). So that would probably be another MWC announcement. Microsoft\/Nokia RM-1072, 73 (AT&T), 74, 75, 76, 77 \u2013 720\u00d71280, 5\u2033. Another phone we\u2019ve covered before and again seen all over the place. Expect soon. Microsoft RM-1109, RM-1113 \u2013 720\u00d71280, 5\u2033. Just a few sightings in Brazil (1109) and in Asia (1113). Could be the same phone as RM-1072 or a specialized variant of it. Microsoft\/Nokia RM-1099 \u2013 480\u00d7800, 4\u201c Unfortunately we haven\u2019t seen anything new from either HTC, Samsung or LG, so we shouldn\u2019t expect any new Windows Phones from them in the MWC timeframe. www.adduplex.com The RM-1062, 63 (AT&T), 64, 65, 66, 67\u00a0 are of course the leaked Lumia 1330 , while the RM -1072, 73 (AT&T), 74, 75, 76, 77\u00a0 is believed to be a lower-specced Lumia 830 . The RM-1099 is believed to be the new 3 megapixel windows phone which will slow above the Lumia 435.

The update is now available for those who purchased the Nokia Lumia 925 smartphone through T-Mobile's official retail channels. The update can't come sooner than this, as Microsoft has already released a technical preview of Windows 10 for phones, but for the time being Nokia Lumia 925 is not among the supported devices. Anyway, Lumia Denim is still far from being available to all those who own Lumia smartphones and even Microsoft want to deploy the update in as many countries as possible, carriers will always delay the upgrade for various reasons. In the United States, T-Mobile is among the first carriers to offer Lumia Denim update for Nokia Lumia 925. AT&T has yet to roll out the Lumia Denim for this smartphone, but since the Magenta has come out with it, then it should not take to long for other carriers start seeding it as well. The update is pushed OTA (over the air), in stages As WindowsCentral points out, many Nokia Lumia 925 owners have reported they have been able to download and install Lumia Denim on their smartphones bought from T-Mobile. In the meantime, T-Mobile updated the support forum page for software versions and updates for Nokia Lumia 925 to reflect any software changes the smartphone might receive. According the post on this forum, beginning February 25, Nokia Lumia 925 devices will receive a notification to update to the latest software version, Windows Phone 8.1. This update will bump the phone's software to version 3051.50009.1451.0018 and will bring \u201cstability improvements,\u201d but also major enhancements when it comes to camera features. There's also one other important thing Lumia 925 owners should take care of. In case you receive an error that says that you need more space, then make sure you have at least 1GB of free storage available.","T-Mobile, Nokia to Step Up Deployment of LTE-U Small Cells":"T-Mobile US, Inc. ( TMUS - Snapshot Report ) has joined with Nokia Corporation ( NOK - Analyst Report ) to accelerate the deployment of small cell units that operate in the unlicensed radio bands. The companies are jointly developing a pre-standards LTE-U (LTE unlicensed) small-cell solution for additional LTE capacity, improved network performance and superior customer experience. LTE-U, which is also known as LAA or licensed assisted access, refers to the use of LTE in 5GHz unlicensed spectrum bands. It makes use of a mix of licensed LTE spectrum and the 5GHz frequency band, which is mainly used for Wi-Fi service at present. By using carrier aggregation between LTE in licensed and unlicensed spectrum, operators can considerably augment connectivity indoors and through hotspots. Notably, small cells are tiny radio base stations that can aid in strengthening voice coverage and data speeds accessible on busy 4G networks. T-Mobile intends to augment its small cell deployment of Nokia Flexi Zone with LAA functionality. The solution will allow the wireless carrier to be an early adopter of this pioneering technology and boost up the capacity of its LTE network. T-Mobile expects to begin deployment of small cells using LTE-U indoors in 2016, followed by outdoor deployments. \u00a0 Interestingly, the deployment of LTE in unlicensed spectrum is intended to complement licensed spectrum deployments and is of particular significance to T-Mobile. The carrier sees it as a way to enlarge its LTE coverage and catch up with rivals AT&T ( T - Analyst Report ) and Verizon Communications ( VZ - Analyst Report ) in terms of 4G footprint. As of now, LAA is considered for 3GPP industry standardization by the middle of next year. Also, Nokia is preparing to incorporate LAA capabilities in its Flexi Zone small cell portfolio at the end of 2015. Further, at the upcoming Mobile World Congress, Nokia will hold a demonstration of the capabilities of LAA using its Nokia Flexi Zone small cells technology, already deployed in T-Mobile\u2019s LTE network. The demonstration will comprise carrier aggregation between LTE in licensed and unlicensed spectrum and the technology\u2019s conformity with Wi-Fi. Notably, Nokia is one of the leaders in small cell technology and this partnership with T-Mobile \u2013 the fourth largest national telecom carrier in the U.S. \u2013 may further leverage its comprehensive portfolio of small cells products. Moreover, T-Mobile is also testing LTE-U small cells with Nokia\u2019s rival Ericsson ( ERIC - Analyst Report ).","Nokia Lumia 1520 on AT&T finally receives Denim update plus unwelcomed app updates":"Yesterday the Internet simply went off the charts. In between llamas on the loose, the color of a dress and those of us on AT&T finally receiving the long awaited Denim update for our Nokia Lumia 1520\u2019s it was a crazy day. Of course, I was on the road to Orlando to pick up my wife returning from a trip to Europe so I was unable to do much with the update when it hit the airwaves. Once I arrived at the airport in Orlando I did go ahead and download the update using the free airport Wi-Fi but held off on applying the update until we started our drive home. I have never (knock on wood) had any problems with past updates for my phones but the last thing I needed was a non-functioning device as I coordinated meeting my wife.\u00a0 There are some things you just simply do not mess around with. I am happy to report though that once we were in the car and had it pointed towards home I started the update which only took about 10 minutes to complete.\u00a0 We have already had many of the features of the Denim update through the Preview for Developers program on Windows Phone but the real jewel in this update is the firmware update that now allows us to use the new Lumia Camera app and it is fast! Anyway, more on that later. The reason for my post this morning is that I have a bone to pick with AT&T about this update. Over the past week there has been a massive conversation about junk ware on our computers \u2013 you know \u2013 all of that unwelcomed stuff that is installed on a brand new device as you turn on the power switch as it comes out of the box. Well it seems AT&T decided that I wanted to have a bunch of their default install apps on my phone after this update despite them having been uninstalled from the phone previously. Of course, once these apps are listed as updates you can cancel them and hopefully not have them show back up at some point in the future to be installed but that is not the real story or solution here. I had already made the decision to remove those apps from my phone so providing me an update to my phone operating system and firmware is not permission for you to force them back on me or any other user again. Here is the list of pre-installed apps I was prompted to update after Denim was on my phone: - AT&T Address Book - AT&T Locker - AT&T Navigator - Device Help - Keeper - MixRadio - Mobile TV I understand that when I buy a brand new device there is some cleaning up to be done to remove the pre-installed items I do not want or use. However, when you blatantly disregard my previous decision to remove these apps and place them back on my device under the premise of an update \u2013 that is dishonest on many levels. Respect mine and others wishes and don\u2019t make us fend off your apps as updates.","Nokia Lumia 10\" 4G Win RT Tablet for AT&T for $200 + free shipping":"Dealfisher via eBay offers the Nokia Lumia 2520 10.1\" 32GB WiFi 4G LTE Windows RT Tablet for AT&T in Black, model no.

In fact, holiday season sales of Apple\u2019s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus propelled the company to the biggest quarterly profit\u2013$18 billion\u2013ever recorded by a public company. Nokia\u2019s Networks unit exceeds Q4 expectations Nokia recorded a strong fourth-quarter profit within its core Networks business, mainly thanks to a boost in North American sales. The result exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations. Specifically, the unit\u2019s fourth-quarter operating profit climbed to 470 million euros ($530 million), or 14% of sales, compared with 397 million euros in the previous quarter. Networks grew modestly in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and just 1% in Asia-Pacific. Gartner industry analyst Sylvain Fabre told\u00a0 Reuters \u00a0that while the Finnish company showed impressive results in North America, the long-term concern is that Nokia is relying on maturing markets such as the United States, Japan and Korea. Qualcomm beats Q1 estimates, lowers earnings outlook Qualcomm beat revenue estimates for its first fiscal quarter, but also lowered its earnings outlook, which hit its share price. The chipmaker notched $7.1 billion in revenue, up 7% compared to the same quarter last year and higher than the $6.94 billion estimated by analysts. Earnings per share of $1.34 were up 6% compared to the same period last year and higher than analysts\u2019 estimates of $1.25 per share. Looking ahead, Qualcomm\u00a0lowered its earnings outlook due to \u201cexpectations that our Snapdragon 810 processor will not be in the upcoming design cycle of a large customer\u2019s flagship device.\u201d It was speculated that the company\u00a0was referring to Samsung\u2019s upcoming flagship phone, the Galaxy S. SK Telecom reports robust Q4 earnings SK Telecom reported an increased number of subscribers to its mobile Internet service and a spike in sales from its business solution service resulted in soaring Q4 earnings. While SK Telecom did not provide detailed figures, company reps said the revenue of its business-to-business solution division had grown 12.7% compared to the same period in 2014. Looking ahead, the company said it plans to expand its \u201cInternet of Things\u201d business and focus on developing new platforms designed to connect business solutions and machines. Apple breaks sales, profit records Apple reported the biggest quarterly profit ever recorded by a public company. Apple cited record iPhone sales as being behind its net profit of $18 billion during its fiscal Q1, which ended Dec. 31.\u00a0The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus propelled Apple to a record-breaking performance during the holiday shopping season, as the company sold 74.5 million iPhones in a single quarter. That\u2019 was a 46% increase from the year-ago quarter, when holiday shoppers were picking up the iPhone 5S and 5C models. Record iPhone sales were matched by record revenue and profits. Quarterly revenue was up 30% year-over-year to $74.6 billion, two-thirds of which came from outside the United States. Net profit\u00a0came in at\u00a0$18 billion, or $3.06 per share. Connected devices, tablets propel AT&T Mobility growth AT&T Mobility reported a more than doubling\u00a0of net connections added during Q4, surging from 809,000 in 2013 to 1.9 million last year. That growth was mainly on the back of connected devices that saw an increase from 398,000 connections in 2013 to nearly 1.3 million net connections last year, and to a lesser extent on postpaid services that jumped 50% to 854,000 net connections last year. AT&T Mobility also managed to trim losses in its resale business, which dipped from a loss of 123,000 connections during Q4 2013 to a loss of just 65,000 connections in 2014. However, AT&T Mobility\u2019s prepaid operations continue to struggle, with that segment\u2019s net losses growing from a loss of 32,000 customers in 2013 to a loss of 180,000 connections last year. AT&T Mobility has been attempting to integrate its prepaid operations\u00a0 under the Cricket brand \u00a0it acquired from Leap Wireless last year, but has so far not been able to show any growth.","Stalking Police With Waze? Here Is Why Google Inc. Should Shut It Down":"Image source: Google Google needs to shut down mapping service, Waze, and sooner is better than later. The company is getting plenty of value out of its $1 billion buyout anyhow, and recent controversy around the service will only hurt its public image. That is the big takeaway from my recent interview with Pete Tenereillo, founder of GPS replacement service, PathSense , and noted expert on social networking and navigation services. His Trapster app helped motorists warn one another of speed traps years before Waze started offering a similar feature. So with Waze running into trouble with the law enforcement community over exactly that type of police-tracking functionality, Tenereillo had already been through that battle many times. Apple eventually banned Trapster from its app store, and the service shut down entirely at the end of 2014. That was four years after Tenereillo had sold the company to Nokia and moved on to found PathSense. It is hard to find an insider with a better view of the Waze situation than Pete Tenereillo. And he was very clear about what Google must do. Waze was never a good fit for the \"do no evil\" image, but it was still a smart acquisition, even at the lofty $1 billion deal price. Tenereillo told me: It's not about money, but it's about Google as a whole. Here's this \"don't be evil\" company, and they're getting a bunch of attention that is potentially not so positive. As the guy running Trapster, my goal was to get the media saying \"Trapster\" as many times as possible, and all publicity was good publicity. Even when it wasn't positive, I was getting my brand out there in front of people. But there is such a thing as bad press when you're Google, and you have a wholesome public image to defend. Or Nokia, who bought my company. In Trapster, Nokia had this thing that they weren't really sure they wanted. The message changed from Trapster helping people to avoid speed traps and became less clear. Nokia presented it as something that helps you with traffic, and safety, but the core functionality was swept under the rug. And over time, Nokia lost the whole Trapster user community, which at 22 million users was fairly significant. They had to shut it down. Does it ever makes sense for a multibillion dollar, multinational company to sell a product that clearly helps people avoid law enforcement? Pete Tenereillo in his natural habitat. Source: Pete Tenereillo It did not make sense for Nokia, and still does not for Google. It is not about the alleged use of Waze as a means of stalking police but as a way of avoiding speeding tickets and DUI violations. Then, we throw in the fact that drivers are expected to report accidents, police hangouts, and other traffic features while driving , all at a time when texting and driving is the focus of heavy media attention, and the whole picture just does not add up to something that Google would value. Sure, shutting down Waze would alienate the 50 million users who love the service, but that is just a drop in the bucket next to the massive Google Maps user base. That comes installed by default on every official Android phone and tablet. How large is that market? Analysts reported over a billion Android devices sold in 2014. So, if Google cares about its \"don't be evil\" mantra, the company had better close the door on Waze before its controversy starts to infect Google as a whole. But, Tenereillo assured me, Google did not completely waste $1 billion on this buyout. Who are we kidding? The speed trap thing is a feature for avoiding police enforcement. And it's very effective. A company like Google can't do that. Shutting down Waze won't affect Google's stock price, with just 50 million users falling by the wayside. Mark my words: Waze will be gone within a year. But the buyout brought a bunch of engineers into Google, with years of mapping expertise and crowdsourcing experience. Even if Waze hadn't brought in any users or an application, it would still have been worth a billion dollars to Google just for the staffing value. Certainly, Google didn't need another map. But even at $10 million per employee, Waze is a good way for Google to add high-quality talent. So, Google may have to shut down Waze before the mapping service becomes a liability. But the buyout kept Waze out of the hands of Apple and other rivals, landed a ton of great engineering talent in Mountain View, and should help Google improve its core Google Maps service over time. Basically, it is a deal with some collateral damage but a valuable buyout nonetheless. Foolish colleague Tim Brugger painted this picture before , and even yours truly more than as a mapping buy. Now Pete Tenereillo nods along in approval. As a Google shareholder, I would have preferred to see the company gain a more direct benefit from this splashy big-ticket buyout, but I agree that Waze will not be a total loss for shareholders.

In November 2014, Microsoft Corp dropped the Nokia name when rolling out its Lumia 535 smartphone, only seven months after its US$7.2 billion deal to buy the Finnish firm\u2019s handset business. Still, Nokia phones are enjoying popularity in Vietnam mostly because of their affordable prices, The Saigon Times Online reported on Wednesday. Upon the April buyout, Nokia continued as a networks, mapping and technology licensing company, according to Reuters. Nokia handsets were continually among the top ten most-sold products at The Gioi Di Dong, a leading Vietnamese mobile products retailer, in the final months of last year. In December alone, four Nokia models, the Lumia 530, 535, 630 and 730, were on the list of bestselling smartphones at The Gioi Di Dong stores, according to The Saigon Times Online. At FPT Shop stores operated by local firm FPT, Nokia\/Microsoft Mobile phones also account for five of the top ten most-sold devices. The products include three feature phone models, namely the Nokia 105, 106 and 206. The Saigon Times Online cited several market research reports while saying that in 2014 Nokia was the market leader in terms of number of devices sold, while Samsung is the No.1 in terms of revenue. Nokia has many affordable feature phones, whereas the world\u2019s largest smartphone maker enjoys strong sales from its medium and top-end segments. The Nokia 105, for instance, is available for only VND430,000 ($20.04), whereas a Samsung Galaxy S5 now fetches around VND10 million ($466). Nokia and Samsung collectively account for around 60 percent of Vietnam\u2019s mobile phone market, according to the Ho Chi Minh City-based newswire. The two, however, began facing harsh competition from growing players such as Asus, Oppo, and LG in the last quarter of 2014. Sales of Vietnamese brands such as Mobiistar and Q-Mobile have also begun to improve. Mobiistar entered the hi-end smartphone segment last year with its Mobiistar Prime 558, and managed to enter the top five brands with the highest sales at FPT Shop, besides Nokia, Samsung, Apple, and China\u2019s Oppo. Worldwide mobile phone sales to end users totaled 455.8 million units in the third quarter of 2014 and were flat compared to the same period in 2013, according to information technology research and advisory company Gartner. Samsung remained the largest vendor with 73.21 million units sold in that quarter, followed by Apple with 38.18 million, and China\u2019s Huawei with 15.93 million."}
